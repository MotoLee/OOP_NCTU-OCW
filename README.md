This is an online course provided by National Chiao-Tung University. The lecturer is Professor Hung-Pin Wen in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. The language used in the course is Chinese Mandarin.

In this course, I learned how to use C++ to write programs in an Object-Oriented way. Prof. Wen clearly described the principles of OOP, and went through most detail part of C++. His clear explanation is very easy to understand for whom has the basic knowledge of C/C++.

As the saying goes, " Practice makes perfect." There are 13 implementation assignments for practice. I've finished all these assignments and put them on my GitHub. There maybe something wrong in my code since no one can help me check the code. If you find one, please let me know. :)
